This is a simple test I did with AngularJs to see if I could use it to sort data.  

You can see how it works here:

The data comes from an array in the Angular_OrderBy.js file.

I setup two controllers (a repeater controller and a count controller).  The repeater is used to iterate through the array and display the data.  The count controller returns a value of 1 and there are a couple functions that are called through buttons to increment or decrement the value.

I borrowed heavily from this Youtube tutorial by JREAM:

and also the documentation at docs.angularjs.org, specifically the orderBy page

https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/orderBy

I also found out that the ng in the Angular modules is short for aNGular!
